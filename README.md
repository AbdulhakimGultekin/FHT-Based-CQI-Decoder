# FHT Based CQI Decoder
In this repository a 4.5G/LTE CQI decoding algorithm has been simulated. The code can be followed regarding the standart (5.2.2.6.4), which is mentioned in the comments of the "test_src.m" file, and the article. At constructing the decoded block a process which is different from the 9th step of the article is performed. If you want to completely follow the article, yes, you can, but then compare the results you get to understand why this difference has been preferred. If you have any questions, you can contact me with: hkmgltkn@gmail.com
