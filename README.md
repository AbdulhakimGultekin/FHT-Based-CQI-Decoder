# FHT Based CQI Decoder
In this repository a CQI decoding algorithm has been simulated. Regarding the standart, which is given in "test_src.m" file, and the
article, the Matlab code can be followed. On constructing the decoded block a process which is different from the 9th step of the article
is performed. If you want to completely follow the article, yes, you can, then compare the results you get to understand why this
difference has been preferred. If you have any questions, you can contact me with: hkmgltkn@gmail.com
